This App is used for managing the Todo Lists and maintain the timer.

Select the name for Login in the app and we store the data in localstorage.

After we get the todo list data according to the user Id's.

You can filter out the tasks (All, completed, incomplete).

Start the timer for tasks, you have 15 seconds to complete the tasks and you can reset the timer easily.

If you complete a 2 tasks and going to start 3rd, you get an alert message to take a break for 10 seconds.
